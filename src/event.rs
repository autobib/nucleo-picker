//! # Extended event handling
//!
//! This module defines the core [`Event`] type handled by a [`Picker`](crate::Picker), which
//! defines an interactive update to the picker state.
//!
//! By default, the interactive picker launched by [`Picker::pick`](crate::Picker::pick) watches
//! for terminal events (such as key presses) and maps them to [`Event`]s. The process of reading
//! events is encapsulated in the [`EventSource`] trait, which you can implement yourself and pass
//! directly to the picker using the [`Picker::pick_with_io`](crate::Picker::pick_with_io).
//!
//! Jump to:
//! - The [`EventSource`] trait.
//! - The [`StdinReader`], for automatically reading events from standard input, with customizable
//!   keybindings.
//! - The [`StdinEventSender`] to read events from standard input and send them through a
//!   [mpsc channel](std::sync::mpsc::channel).
//! - The [default keybindings](keybind_default), which are also useful to provide fallbacks for
//!   keybind customization
//!
//! For somewhat comprehensive examples, see the [extended fzf
//! example](https://github.com/autobib/nucleo-picker/blob/master/examples/fzf_err_handling.rs) or
//! the [restart
//! example](https://github.com/autobib/nucleo-picker/blob/master/examples/restart.rs).

/// An event which controls the picker behaviour.
///
/// The type parameters `T` and `R` are the item type and the [`Render`](crate::Render)
/// implementation specific to the picker respectively. The type parameter `A` is the
/// application-defined error which can be used to conveniently propagate application errors
/// independent of the picker to the main thread where the picker is running.
///
/// Most events are explained directly in the enum variant documentation. A few special cases
/// require a bit more detail: [redraw](#redraw),
/// [application-defined abort](#application-defined-abort), and [restart](#restart)
///
/// ## Redraw
/// In most cases, it is not necessary to manually send an [`Event::Redraw`] since the default
/// behaviour of the picker is to automatically redraw on each frame if the state of the screen
/// would change when handling an event, or when the item list is updated internally.
///
/// There is no `Resize` variant since the screen size is automatically checked immediately before
/// drawing to the screen. If you are generating your own events, propagate a screen resize as a
/// [`Event::Redraw`], which will force a redraw to respect the new screen size.
///
/// ## Application-defined abort
/// The abort event is a special event used to propagate errors from the application to the picker.
/// When the picker receives an abort event, it immediately terminates and passes the abort event
/// onwards inside the [`PickError::Aborted`](crate::error::PickError::Aborted) error variant.
///
/// By default, the associated type parameter is `!`, which means that [`Event::Abort`] cannot be
/// constructed in ordinary circumstances. In order to generate [`Event::Abort`], you must use the
/// [`Picker::pick_with_io`](crate::Picker::pick_with_io) method and pass an appropriate
/// [`EventSource`] which generates your desired errors.
///
/// The provided [`EventSource`] implementations, namely [`StdinReader`] and
/// [`mpsc::Receiver`](std::sync::mpsc::Receiver), are both generic over the same type parameter
/// `A` so you can construct this variant with a custom error type if desired.
///
/// ## Restart
/// The [`Event::Restart`] is used to restart the picker while it is still running. After a
/// restart, all previously created [`Injector`][i]s become invalidated. Therefore to receive a valid
/// [`Injector`][i], the caller must watch for new injectors using the
/// [`Observer`] returned by [`Picker::injector_observer`](crate::Picker::injector_observer`).
///
/// When the [`Event::Restart`] is processed by the picker, it will clear the item list and
/// immediately update the observer with the new [`Injector`][i]. If the send fails because
/// there is no receiver, the picker will fail with
/// [`PickError::Disconnected`](crate::error::PickError::Disconnected). Note that the observer is
/// essentially a bounded channel of length 1; and the picker will overwrite any previously pushed
/// [`Injector`][i] when pushing the updated one to the channel. In particular, the [`Injector`][i]
/// in the channel (if any) is always the most up-to-date.
///
/// It is possible that no [`Injector`][i] will be sent if the picker exists
/// or disconnects before the event is processed.
///
/// For a detailed implementation example, see the [restart
/// example](https://github.com/autobib/nucleo-picker/blob/master/examples/restart.rs).

/// An abstraction over sources of [`Event`]s which drive a [`Picker`](crate::Picker).
///
/// Usually, you do not need to implement this trait yourself and can instead use one of the
/// provided implementations:
///
/// - An implementation for [`StdinReader`], which reads key events interactively from standard
///   input and supports custom key bindings.
/// - An implementation for the [`Receiver`] end of a [`sync::mpsc`](std::sync::mpsc) channel.
///
/// The [`Receiver`] implementation means, in most cases, you can simply run an event driver in a
/// separate thread and pass the receiver to the [`Picker`](crate::Picker). This might also be
/// useful when co-existing with other parts of the application which might themselves generate
/// events which are relevant for a picker. Also see the [`StdinEventSender`] struct.
///
/// ## Debouncing
/// The picker automatically debounces incoming events, so you do not need to handle this yourself.
/// However, since there are limitations to the commutativity of events, if the event stream is
/// very overactive, the picker may still lag.
///
/// ## Associated `AbortErr` type
/// The associated `AbortErr` type defines the application-specific error type which may be
/// propagated directly to the picker. This is the same type as present in
/// [`PickError::Aborted`](crate::error::PickError) as well as [`Event::Abort`].
///
/// If you do not need to construct this variant at all, you should set `AbortErr = !` so that
/// you do not need to match on the corresponding [`PickError`](crate::error::PickError) variant.
///
/// The provided implementations for [`StdinReader`] and [`Receiver`] are both generic over a type
/// parameter `A` which defaults to `A = !`. This type parameter is used as `AbortErr` in the
/// provided [`EventSource`] implementation.
///
/// ## Implementation example
/// Here is an example implementation for a `crossbeam::channel::Receiver`. This is identical to
/// the implementation for [`mpsc::Receiver`](std::sync::mpsc::Receiver).
/// ```
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// use crossbeam::channel::{Receiver, RecvTimeoutError};
/// use nucleo_picker::event::{Event, EventSource, RecvError};
///
/// struct EventReceiver<A> {
///     inner: Receiver<Event<A>>
/// }
///
/// impl<A> EventSource for EventReceiver<A> {
///     type AbortErr = A;
///
///     fn recv_timeout(&self, duration: Duration) -> Result<Event<A>, RecvError> {
///         self.inner.recv_timeout(duration).map_err(|err| match err {
///             RecvTimeoutError::Timeout => RecvError::Timeout,
///             RecvTimeoutError::Disconnected => RecvError::Disconnected,
///         })
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Usage example
/// This is a partial usage example illustrating how to use a [`Receiver`]
///
/// In order to complete this example, one should also call
/// [`Picker::pick_with_io`](crate::Picker::pick_with_io) using the
/// receiver end of the channel.

///
/// The default keybindings are documented

/// events.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// Use the [`keybind_default`] function to simplify your implementation of keybindings:
/// ```
/// use crossterm::event::{KeyCode, KeyEvent, KeyEventKind, KeyModifiers};
/// use nucleo_picker::event::{keybind_default, Event, StdinReader};
///
/// /// Keybindings which use the default keybindings, but instead of interrupting on `ctrl + c`,
/// /// instead performs a normal quit action. Generic over all possible `Event` type parameters
/// /// for flexibility.

///         KeyEvent {
///             kind: KeyEventKind::Press,
